# Posing Clinic

An AI-powered application that provides real-time feedback and critiques for bodybuilding poses. Using advanced AI vision and natural language processing, this tool helps bodybuilders perfect their posing technique through detailed analysis and suggestions.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Modern CSS-in-JS styling
- Context API for state management

### Backend
- FastAPI (Python)
- Groq API for AI image analysis
- MinIO for image storage
- PostgreSQL database
- Docker for containerization

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (for local development)
- Python 3.11+ (for local development)
- A Groq API key

### Environment Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
POSTGRES_USER=admin
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret
POSTGRES_DB=mydb
MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin
MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=minioadmin
MINIO_ENDPOINT=minio:9000
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
MINIO_SECRET_KEY=minioadmin
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the entire stack using Docker Compose:
```bash
./run.sh
```

This will start:
- Frontend at http://localhost:5173
- Backend API at http://localhost:8000
- MinIO at http://localhost:9000 (API) and http://localhost:9001 (Console)
- PostgreSQL at localhost:5432

To stop the application:
```bash
./stop.sh
```

### Local Development

#### Frontend
```bash
cd posing-clinic-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Backend
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

#### Access Swagger docs 

To access the swagger docs and experiment with the endpoints go to the following url after running the backend service
```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```
